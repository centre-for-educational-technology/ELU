    'why.desc' => 'Project-based learning is important because in today’s world the work arrangement of different areas of life is more often than not project-based: concrete goals have to be achieved by given deadlines and on limited resources, and solutions have to be sought to non-standard tasks. All of it is often carried out in the form of teamwork.',
    'why.desc2' => 'The ability to solve interdisciplinary problems will be useful in future work life since we inevitably have to handle issues and ideas that reach beyond one single field. ELU projects will enable to carry out your own ideas, practice working together and communicate with different people. Participating in an ELU project is a possibility to develop your leadership and social skills as well as your initiative and to gain basic knowledge of how to plan and carry out projects. ELU is a compulsory subject in Tallinn University so as to provide all the students with an innovative experience of studying and doing activities together and experience the possibility of applying their knowledge when solving issues that are interdisciplinary in nature and are likely to occur in real work life.',
    'when' => 'When?',
    'when.desc' => 'Students themselves can choose when to carry out an ELU project. Unlike ordinary subjects, the preparation of the projects must be started during the previous semester, as the team needs to be formed before the beginning of the semester.',
    'when.desc2' => 'An ELU project may last for one or two semesters, depending on its goals and content. The timeframe of carrying out the project is agreed upon among the students and the supervisor(s) during the first meeting. If an ELU project lasts for two semesters, the course will be added to the study plan during the second semester (the credit points will be received at the end of the project). Registration for ELU course can be done only on ELU website and the students do not have to register for the course in ÕIS. It is recommended to take the course before the last semester, i.e. before the semester of writing the final thesis.',

    'with_who.desc' => 'ELU team consists of 6-8 students. If there are more students interested in one and the same topic, sub-teams will be formed. Since it is an interdisciplinary project, each team should include students from at least three different study areas.',

    'with_who.desc2' => 'ELU teams are formed based on an idea of interest. Students can choose which supervisor’s project to join, or they can come forward with their own idea. To add their own idea for a project a form “I have an idea” needs to be filled in on the website and it will be then forwarded to the database of ELU projects for revision. The next step would be to find a teacher-supervisor for the idea.',

    'with_who.desc3' => 'The ideas for ELU projects are introduced at the Idea Fair and on ELU website. Idea Fair is an event supporting the formation of teams and it takes place twice a year (in May and December). Joining a project and registration for ELU course can be done only on ELU website.',
    'with_who.desc4' => 'An ELU project can be carried out following either of the two models: ELU 1.0 where members of the teaching staff lead the project, and ELU 2.0 where the project leader is a student. ELU 1.0 projects are initiated by one or more members of the teaching staff. They come forward with an idea, help with forming a suitable team and guide the students towards achieving the goal. In addition to supervisors, ELU teams can ask for input from specialists of relevant areas.',
    'with_who.desc5' => 'In ELU 2.0 model the whole responsibility of planning, carrying out and defending a project lies on the student. The project leader is a student who is most probably also the author of the idea. Each ELU 2.0 team has a mentor-teacher who will give feedback and advice, if necessary. This model, based on the responsibility of the student, enables the students to put their ideas into real-life practice and develop leadership skills and initiative.',

    'how' => 'How?',
    'how.desc' => 'Everything starts with an idea. Ideas can be proposed by the students, members of the teaching staff or by a partner from outside the university. Each ELU project needs to include at least one member of the university teaching staff.',
    'how.desc2' => 'When preparing an ELU project the author of the idea needs to consider what kind of students from different study areas could be needed for the project and who would be suitable to supervise the project. It should also be taken into account that the idea cannot be too expansive for the project and a draft framework for carrying out the project should be outlined.',
    'how.desc3' => 'The next step is to enter the idea on ELU website and introduce it at Idea Fair. Idea Fair is where the stage of forming the teams begins. Idea Fair takes place twice during the academic year, so as to give enough time for first meetings and for forming the teams before the beginning of the semester.',
    'how.desc4' => 'During the first meeting of ELU teams concrete goals and the timeframe of the activities are agreed upon and agreements are made to facilitate the process of achieving the final outcome. In order to carry out the project in a successful manner, the tasks are divided among the members of the team and regular meetings are held with the students and the supervisor. During the meetings with the supervisor the students present the state of the project and, if necessary, get feedback and input.',
    'how.desc5' => 'Before the end of the semester, the outcome of the project has to be formulated and presented and an evaluation of one’s own contribution and of the team members must be given. The possible dates for presentation of the projects, being the deadlines for finishing the projects, are declared at the beginning of each semester, so that the students and supervisors could get acquainted with other ELU projects.',

    'which.desc2' => 'The goal of an ELU project and activities necessary for reaching the goal and the timeframe are agreed upon in the project draft after the team has been formed. The compulsory parts of the subject are the draft of the project, evaluation of one’s own contribution and of the team members and presentation of the outcome. ',
